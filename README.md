## Members Responsibility

All **Push** and **Pull Request** will be done on a members personal branch.

After morning stand up, all members will then commit code that was edited and does not conflict with other members code commits. This will then be pushed to the **development** branch. After the final push to the **development** the team github manager will push to the **main** branch.
